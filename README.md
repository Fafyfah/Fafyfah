### 🌱 Global Missing Migrants Exploratory Dashboard
Migration is a global issue involving a large-scale force displacement of refugee and migrants across the world, accompanied by a number of deaths and disappearances during their dangerous journeys. In this project, I use Global Missing Migrants Dataset from IOM missing migrants project to explore data insights. The outcome of this project includes **an interactive exploratory dashboard** creating with `tableau`, and **a notebook** that shows how I use `Python/pandas` to demonstrate the data preparation process for Exploratory Data Analysis.

### 🌱 Data Science Bootcamp Project (DataRockie)
Data science bootcamp with DataRockie is a 6-month intensive program I took during 2022-2023 (Batch 6). The bootcamp provides solid foundations on these topics : Spreadsheets, SQL databases, R, Python, Data Transformation, Data Visualization, Statistics, Intro to Machine Learning, and Dashboard. This repository will contain all the `projects/homework` I have done in this course.
