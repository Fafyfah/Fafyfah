### Global Missing Migrants Exploratory Dashboard
Migration is a global issue involving a large-scale force displacement of refugee and migrants across the world, accompanied by a number of deaths and disappearances during their dangerous journeys. In this project, I use Global Missing Migrants Dataset from IOM missing migrants project to explore data insights. The outcome of this project includes **an interactive exploratory dashboard** creating with `tableau`, and **a notebook** that shows how I use `Python/pandas` to demonstrate the data preparation process for Exploratory Data Analysis.
