## üìÅ Data Analyst Projects

### üå± Global Missing Migrants Exploratory Dashboard
Migration is a global issue involving a large-scale force displacement of refugee and migrants across the world, accompanied by a number of deaths and disappearances during their dangerous journeys. In this project, I use Global Missing Migrants Dataset from IOM missing migrants project to explore data insights. The outcome of this project includes **an interactive exploratory dashboard** creating with `tableau`, and **a notebook** that shows how I use `Python/pandas` to demonstrate the data preparation process for Exploratory Data Analysis.

### üå± Data Science Bootcamp Project (DataRockie)
Data science bootcamp with¬†DataRockie¬†is a 6-month intensive program I took during 2022-2023 (Batch 6). The bootcamp provides solid foundations on these topics : Spreadsheets, SQL databases, R, Python, Data Transformation, Data Visualization, Statistics, Intro to Machine Learning, and Dashboard. This repository will contain all the `projects/homework` I have done in this course.

### üå± Cleaned Bike Sales Data Project
The bike sales dataset obtained from Kaggle is unclean, it consists of missing value and inconsistent data. This project utilize `Python/pandas` to clean data and make it ready to be used for any kind of analysis.

### üå± Formula 1 Race Data: SQL Data Extraction Project
In this project, I wrote `SQL queries` to extract insights from Formula 1 race data from the years 1950 to 2017. I utilized SELECT, JOIN, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, and HAVING to retrieve and filter data effectively. This work aims to demonstrate my proficiency in SQL query writing and data manipulation skill.
